#### Discussion Post #1

[](https://github.com/ProfessionalLinuxUsersGroup/lac/blob/main/src/u6ws.md#discussion-post-1)

Scenario:

> A ticket has come in from an application team. Some of the servers your team built for them last week have not been reporting up to enterprise monitoring and they need it to be able to troubleshoot a current issue, but they have no data. You jump on the new servers and find that your engineer built everything correctly and the agents for node_exporter, ceph_exporter and logstash exporter that your teams use. But, they also have adhered to the new company standard of firewalld must be running. No one has documented the ports that need to be open, so you‚Äôre stuck between the new standards and fixing this problem on live systems.

Next, answer these questions here:

1. As you‚Äôre looking this up, what terms and concepts are new to you?
	1. ``` Some terms and concepts that I have not heard of while doing this exercise are: node_exporter, ceph_exporter, logstash, WAF (Web Application Firewall). Personally I have heard of a WAF however, practical implementation of one, I have no clue.  ```
    
2. What are the ports that you need to expose? How did you find the answer?
	1. `node_exporter: TCP Port 9100`
	2. `ceph_exporter: Port 9128
	3. `logstash: Ports 5044, 9600, and 9700
    
3. What are you going to do to fix this on your firewall?
	    ` 1. If I were to fix this issue I would first gather all the applicable information that is needed in order to fix this issue. After gathering port information, I would then relay that information up the chain just to ensure that all applicable parties are aware of the changes that need to be made.`
	    `2. Once everyone is aware of the change, I would utilize this command structure to add the applicable ports to the firewall: 
	    `sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=<port_number>/<protocol>`
		`3. Report completion of changes and conduct an operational test to verify communications are satisfactory.`
#### Discussion Post #2

[](https://github.com/ProfessionalLinuxUsersGroup/lac/blob/main/src/u6ws.md#discussion-post-2)

Scenario:

> A manager heard you were the one that saved the new application by fixing the firewall. They get your manager to approach you with a request to review some documentation from a vendor that is pushing them hard to run a WAF in front of their web application. You are ‚Äúthe firewall‚Äù guy now, and they‚Äôre asking you to give them a review of the differences between the firewalls you set up (which they think should be enough to protect them) and what a WAF is doing.

1. What do you know about the differences now?
	1. `In the context of this scenario I am assuming that since we are the "Firewall Guy" now, we are in charge of network firewalls and Web Application Firewalls. The main difference that I am seeing is their responsibilities. Web Application Firewalls sit in front of a web app whereas a network firewall sits on the outside of a DMZ that filters inbound and outbound traffic. `
    
2. What are you going to do to figure out more?
	1. `In this scenario, I would first ask anyone else in the office whether they have some experience with working with a WAF or a Firewall. If nobody can assist then here comes doctor google. Looking up basic setup of the specific WAF that we are trying to implement.  `
    
3. Prepare a report for them comparing it to the firewall you did in the first discussion.

## Definitions

[](https://github.com/ProfessionalLinuxUsersGroup/lac/blob/main/src/u6ws.md#definitions)

---

Firewall: Firewalls, on a basic level, are in charge of the monitoring, denial, and acceptance of packets that are sent across a network either from outside a local network or internally. 

Zone: Logical groupings of network interfaces or devices within a network that are subject to the same firewall policies. 

Service: These are the processes that run in the background of the computer that run specific tasks without user interaction. In relation to firewalls, we can block certain services from accessing the network. 

DMZ: Demilitarized Zone, is a physical or logical subnet that separates a LAN from other untrusted networks -- usually, the public internet. 

Proxy: Is a server that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server and can handle requests and responses. It can be used for various purposes like security, privacy, and accessing geographical restricted content. 

Stateful packet filtering: Security mechanism where a firewall keeps track of the state of network connections to make more informed decisions about packet to block or allow. 

Stateless packet filtering: Security mechanism that does not include packet inspection however utilizes fixed rules that can allow or deny packets. 

WAF: Web Application Firewalls protect APIs and web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP Traffic. 

NGFW: Next Generation Firewalls, expands on the standard firewall capabilities by utilizing application control, intrusion prevention, and threat intelligence.
