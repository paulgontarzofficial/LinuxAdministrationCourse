# Instructions

Fill out this sheet as you progress through the lab and discussions. Hold onto all of your work to send to me at the end of the course.

# Discussion Questions:

**Unit 4 Discussion Post 1**: Read this article: [https://cio-wiki.org/wiki/Operations_Bridge](https://cio-wiki.org/wiki/Operations_Bridge)

1. What terms and concepts are new to you?

2. Which pro seems the most important to you? Why?

3. Which con seems the most costly, or difficult to overcome to you? Why?

**Unit 4 Discussion Post 2:** Your team has no documentation around how to check out a server during an incident. Write out a procedure of what you think an operations person should be doing on the system they suspect is not working properly. This may help, to get you started ([https://zeltser.com/media/docs/security-incident-survey-cheat-sheet.pdf?msc=Cheat+Sheet+Blog](https://zeltser.com/media/docs/security-incident-survey-cheat-sheet.pdf?msc=Cheat+Sheet+Blog)) You may use AI for this, but let us know if you do.
